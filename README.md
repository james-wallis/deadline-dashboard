# deadline-dashboard


The deadline-dashboard for my second year WebScript coursework.

## Web Application Brief


Your challenge is to create a Configurable Dashboard.

You are to specify and construct this configurable dashboard using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and (optionally) PHP, and any backing store you desire (e.g. a database).

Example use cases include:
in the home (perhaps for helping a family see what the weather will be like, their upcoming schedule, the latest tweets from their friends, etc.), updated at appropriate intervals.
in an office (such as the BK first floor, where we have a flat panel for displaying information to staff and visitors).  A combination of live data from the web and various databases, stories from various sources, images and video may all need to be displayed.

Configuration of your dashboard may be achieved by editing config files, or through a Dashboard Editor created as part of your deliverable artifact â€“ this is your choice.

Your task is to show (through your work) the extent to which you have met the learning outcomes for the unit.

The learning outcomes (as defined in the Unit Spec.) are:
Identify industry best practices in web application design (e.g. client, server and API layers).
Design a contemporary web application using industry best practices.
Critically evaluate the design and implementation of web applications.




## Running the dashboard


To get the dashboard running, you must install the source code and all modules and then run the server from the command line:

1. To download the code, use git (the simplest option):

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/jamesemwallis/deadline-dashboard.git
  cd deadline-dashboard
  ```

2. To download any libraries the code uses, type:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

3. Install and run MySQL.
    * If you're using your VM for this, MySQL is already installed and running.

4. Edit `sql_config.json` so that your database `host`, `user` and `password` properties are correct.
    * The defaults may not work on your VM, as this project is mostly run from a different server.

5. Install the database and tables using: `npm run initsql`
    * If your `host` and `user` differ from the defaults, you may need to update `package.json` for the `initsql` script to work.

6. Start the server by typing:

  ```bash
  npm run dashboard
  ```

  This ensures that if you edit the code (or upload a new version), the server will restart.

5. Visit your website.
    * If you're on your VM you just need to put your VM's IP address into a browser, or if you're developing on a desktop machine it will be http://127.0.0.1:8080.

### Use of Last FM


The Dashboard takes in a users lastfm username so it is ideal if you create one before you start the dashboard for the first time.
There is currently no way to change the lastfm username once the user has been created (but this feature will be added once the coursework has been submitted. Reason for lack of function: Ran out of time.)

Through using last fm you can display your currently playing song on last fm, but also last fm can be added to Spotify in order to display your Spotify currently playing.

## About the Dashboard


The Dashboard is _currently_ designed for one user and one user only. Adding more than one user to the database will not change anything in the dashboard.
It has been designed for personal use outside of its coursework origins. I intend to use it as either a new tab page for chrome or a dashboard in my bedroom.
Its major purpose is to tell me my upcoming deadlines and also to keep me updated with the news, displaying the weather and telling me what my Spotify is playing.

### Actors/Users

The dashboard is designed to be used in a personal space. In the future it will be used by a developer to do what they want with it and the will be able to understand what function does what as the code is clear in most places.

It could be expanded to other end users, but this would require more implementation to have multiple users and also need an easy way to add more api's to the dashboard whilst also being able to easily change stylings to their taste.

## Coursework Reflection

### Functionality

> How appropriate is the design?  Does it all work?  How much does it do?  How much is your own work as opposed to libraries?

Firstly, the design. I think the design complements its features. While sometimes there are scaling issues on smaller screens, on larger ones, for which it is designed, it looks clear and easy to read. It was designed to sit in the background of a room, not attracting attention so that it would not be a distraction, however the coloured deadlines make them stand out on the page.

It mostly all works, there are features such as grey scaling the deadlines on the deadline page which did not get implemented as well as making the clock 24hrs as an option. However everything else that has been created works as it should.

It does _a lot_.

The Dashboard is able to show different api's (the news ones are especially easy to add), such as news, last fm, quotes and the weather.
It is customisable as the user can choose which api's to see in which box.
Additionally, the user is able to add deadlines and course units in order to view the deadlines that are up and coming.
For the news boxes I use [News API](https://newsapi.org/) to get the current news. This allows me to easily add new id's for the content whilst using the same styling for each news box.

Most of the dashboard is my own work, but I use the library [Sweet Alert](http://t4t5.github.io/sweetalert/) in order to do form confirms.

_Areas for improvement_

* If I had more time, I would add more api's to select and add to the dashboard. The main issue with this at the moment is that unless it comes from newsAPI the custom styling for each different api is custom to it.
* The functionality to change a user profile after it has been created.
* The ability to see passed deadlines as well as mark them as completed.
* Functionality to display when there is less than a week until a deadline.

### Maintainability

> Code style, comprehensibility and maintainability. This includes formatting, file structure, naming - everything that can help your work live on and be useful after it is graded, including how well the code and any documentation communicates any concepts necessary to understand the architecture and configuration of the system.

All code is formatted in a readable manner, with each function having a comment instructing the user/developer what it does.
To this end I believe that the code is clear, yet I know it could be improved as there are functions that could be created to stop duplication of code.
Each function is named in such a way that it attempts to portray clearly what it does without comments.
Huge downside of the dashboard is the file structure. Apart from the server.js file, all javascript, html and css files are in the same folder when they should be split into separate ones. This became apparent very close to the deadline for the coursework and I decided that I wouldn't take the risk that changing the locations of the file would break the dashboard.

_Areas for improvement_

* Code duplication needs to be reduced.
* Comments could be made better and more informative in places
* File structure needs a revamp

### Usability

> Ease-of-use of your system, including the use of event-driven input, background refresh, drag and drop, intuitive UI design, etc.

The dashboard is easy to use. The main difficulty with it is finding the settings menu button. This is because I have intentionally hidden it so that it is not easy to see when the dashboard is being displayed (with no user input) for long periods of time.
I created an introduction page which runs after the user account has been created which contains a .gif and description of where the menu bar is located.
There is a lot of background-refresh which takes place to refresh the news boxes and the lastfm one particularly (the lastfm refresh takes place every second so that it updates when the song changes).
I have not used drag and drop and in hindsight think that this is the right decision as I believe it would distract from the purpose of the dashboard and overcomplicate it.

_Areas for improvement_

* UI could have some improvement to make things clearer such as font scaling for different sizes screens.
* Feedback could be taken from different users to get ideas on different menu buttons or whether the current, hidden button is fine for the dashboard.

### Accessibility

> The appearance of your pages, including use of CSS and relevant capabilities such that the product is suitable for a diverse audience.

The dashboard is clear when used. However I have not used such things as aria tags to aid users that might otherwise find the dashboard hard to use due to a disability or otherwise.
When creating the dashboard I did not pay much attention to Accessibility for others as I was focused on functionality a vast amount more. In hindsight this was a mistake on my part and in future I intend to make my projects accessible to everyone by using particular colours (for the colour blind), aria tags and other accessibility concepts to aid users.

_Areas for improvement_

* Addition of aria tags.
* Option for the colour blind to make the dashboard clearer.
* Option to make text bigger, (possibly through the use of less boxes on the dashboard, creating more room)

### Reflection

> Marked for insight, analysis and evaluation of encountered designs and technologies.

Hopefully the above helps a vast amount with my reflection on the project but if not I will outline some key points below.

* The dashboard performs well as a dashboard as well as a deadline tracker. The deadline tracker functionality is large as I feel as though I have given the user enough functionality to create, amend and delete each deadline as they please, as well as letting them add units and take them away, whilst also being able to choose the colours that they have as their deadline background.

* The Addition of more API's should be made easier.

* Creation, modification and deletion of the user account should be made available.

* **Unfixed Error**: The dashboard currently runs all getApi functions for the dashboard no matter if the api is currently being used or not. Not only does this create mass errors in the console, but it also hinders the performance of the program. This is an urgent error that needs to be fixed, however it also fell into the category or 'running out of time' on this occasion.

* **Bad Practice**: Currently, the dashboard does not do a great amount to validate forms (in some cases none). This obviously needs to be fixed and all forms should have a lot of validation so that the user can enter nothing which will break the system or cause it not to work properly.

* The code quality could be better, I should be able to use more ECMAScript 6 functionality to make the code more concise and readable. Furthermore the comments could be more descriptive, although at the moment I feel that they are able to describe what a function does clearly.

* The dashboard has a nice feel to it and is easy to use.

* It lacks clear accessibility functionality which should be addressed in future updates and projects.

### Invention

> We will award up to 10 bonus marks for unusual qualities, strengths, creativity and invention not otherwise prescribed here.

**Do I think I have any invention in the project?**

In terms of invention, I have not made anything ground-breaking or never seen before, however I feel that the deadline feature counts towards invention.
As already mentioned the deadline functionality is vast and I think it counts towards invention due to:
* A user controls which units they have and can add and delete them at will.
* The user controls what background colour is shown for each unit.
* If a user deletes (or in a real world scenario, stops taking) a unit, the dashboard will delete all deadlines that went with it.
* The user is able to easily modify deadlines.
* The user is able to easily list all deadlines by either date or unit title, making easy viewing for them.
